# Mission-to-Mars
## Summary
For this project I utilized new tools such as Flask, MongoDB, beautifulsoup, and splinter. I was able to create a webpage that automatically scrapes data from numerous websites about mars. The webpage compiles different aspects about mars such as photos, facts and recent headlines about the planet.
